## 📖 About The Project
This project is an **AgriTech MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** designed to help farmers monitor crop health remotely. It bridges the gap between hardware (IoT sensors) and software (Cloud Dashboard).

Unlike standard web apps, this project implements a full **DevSecOps pipeline**, ensuring that every update is automatically tested, scanned for security vulnerabilities, and containerized before deployment.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Tracks Temperature, Humidity, and Soil Moisture levels.
- **Remote Automation:** Allows users to toggle water pumps via a secure Web Dashboard.
- **Data Persistence:** Uses SQL to store historical sensor data for analysis.
- **Smart Logic:** Python Class-based architecture to model physical sensors.
- **Secure Deployment:** Dockerized application with automated CI/CD workflows.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Backend:** Python (Flask)
* **Database:** SQLite / SQL
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Fetch API)
* **DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
* **Security:** Trivy (Vulnerability Scanning)
